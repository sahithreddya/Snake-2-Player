# Snake-2-Player
A 2 Player snake game where both players can control their respective snakes using a single keyboard.


Game starts with 2 snakes starting from the left top and left bottom.
Each players gets a point if they eat the food with their respective snake.
A snake can move freely across the borders, where it will continue to slither on the opposite side of the border.
A player loses if his/her snake collides with itself.

I ran this code at http://dartpad.dartlang.org which is an online execution environment for Dart.
